<p>Chapati is a simple and delicious dish to prepare. Serve this Indian flatbread with curries or use it as a sandwich wrap.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
   
    <li>1 cup whole wheat flour</li>
        <li>   1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>  1 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li> Â¾ cup hot water or as needed</li>
                    <li> 2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
   <li> Mix flours and salt in a large bowl. Use a wooden spoon to stir in water and olive oil. Mix until a soft, elastic dough forms and add more water, if needed. Knead dough on a lightly floured surface until smooth.</li><br/>
    <li>Divide dough into 10 equal portions, or less if you want larger chapatis. Roll each piece into a ball and let rest for a few minutes.</li><br/>
    <li>Heat a lightly greased skillet over medium heat.</li><br/>
    <li>Use a rolling pin to roll dough balls out on a lightly floured surface until very thin, like a tortilla.</li><br/>
    <li>When the skillet starts to smoke, place a chapati in it. Cook until bottom has brown spots, about 30 seconds, then flip and cook 30 seconds more. Repeat to cook remaining chapatis.</li>
</ol>
